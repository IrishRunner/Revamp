                    <p class="paragraph">Revamp started in June 2006 to bridge a gap in the market for jobs that were too large or time consuming for home owners, yet too small to detract other trades people away from the lucrative building economy at the time. </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Standards</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Revamp aims to define a new higher standard in home building, maintenance, and renovation. We pride ourselves on our quality of work, with the job deemed finished only when our customers are completely satisfied. We provide a reliable and efficient service using only top quality materials. You can relax in the knowledge that once it&rsquo;s done, it has been done right! All work is fully insured.</p> 
                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Teamwork</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">No one person can do it all and as a result, one of the hardest things for a builder to do is put together a team of professionals from across the trades with no weak links. Thankfully for Revamp, this process has come together. </p>
                    <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Managing your project </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Your Revamp job will always have somebody on-site who knows every aspect of the final goal so as each trade is directed not only on their own work, but how to facilitate all following trades. This can be the difference between a good job and a great job. </p>
